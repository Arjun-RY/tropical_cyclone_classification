# Tropical cyclones classification
Classifying tropical_cyclones using Logistic Regression

# Problem Statement
Information about Tropical cyclones happened since 1950 were given in a dataset. Dataset contains details like (year, storm_name, start_date, end_date, dates, max_wind_speed_mph, min_pressure_mb, storm_type). Using ML algorithms, a model has to be generated to accurately classify the type of cyclone(Either it has to be tropical storm or hurricane).
